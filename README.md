<p align="center">In this project, 
I challenged myself putting in practice very important concepts from React and stylization, like Grid, integration with API, versioning, componentization, organization, 
form validation, routes navigation, documentation and so much more...

I am very proud to had the opportunity, it was a huge learning experience from start to finish :)
